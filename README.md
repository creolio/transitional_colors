# Transitional Colors

Take a list of rgb color values and insert a number of colors of your choice in between each given color pair in a smooth transition.

Optionally, ensure all colors fall within a luminance range to ensure enough contrast from both black and white for the entire range. Great for adjusting the color range for dark/light modes.
